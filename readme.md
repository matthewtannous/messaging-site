## Frontend operations
The website uses cookies to ensure users remain logged in after entering their information in the login/signup form.
Once logged in, they can search for other users and send friend requests.
Once this request is accepted, the users can chat together and edit messages after they are sent.
Users can also modify their email address and password, log out and delete their account.
